# ft_printf_tester-dbekic
Tester for the mandatory part of ft_printf.

#### Current Flaws
- Does not check for leaks. Be especially careful with hexadecimal conversions.
- Does not check for already freed memory.

## How to run
Clone repo into your ft_printf root directory, cd into this directory and run command: 
```
./venga
```
